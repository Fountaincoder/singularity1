abstract = {Deep learning has been extensively researched in various areas and scales up very fast in the last decade. It has deeply permeated into our daily life, such as image classification, video synthesis, autonomous driving, voice recognition, and personalized recommendation systems. The main challenge for most deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and recommendation models, is their large amount of computation. Fortunately, most computations in deep learning applications are parallelizable, therefore they can be effectively handled by throughput processors, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs support high throughput, parallel processing performance, and high memory bandwidth and becomes the most popularly adopted device for deep learning. As a matter of fact, many deep learning workloads from mobile devices to data centers are performed by GPUs. In particular, modern GPU systems provide specialized hardware modules and software stacks for deep learning workloads. In this chapter, we present detailed analysis on the evolution of GPU architectures and the recent hardware and software supports for more efficient acceleration of deep learning in GPUs. Furthermore, we introduce leading-edge researches, challenges, and opportunities of running deep learning workloads on GPUs.}

  abstract  = {From the Publisher:From 1983 to 1986, the legendary physicist and teacher Richard Feynman gave a course at Caltech called "Potentialities and Limitations of Computing Machines." Although the lectures are over ten years old, most of the material is timeless and presents a "Feynmanesque" overview of many standard and some not-so-standard topics in computer science. These include compatibility, Turing machines (or as Feynman said, "Mr. Turing's machines"), information theory, Shannon's Theorem, reversible computation, the thermodynamics of computation, the quantum limits to computation, and the physics of VLSI devices. Taken together, these lectures represent a unique exploration of the fundamental limitations of digital computers. Feynman's philosophy of learning and discovery comes through strongly in these lectures. He constantly points out the benefits of playing around with concepts and working out solutions to problems on your own - before looking at the back of the book for the answers. As Feynman says in the lectures: "If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one! And that's the way to become a computer scientist."}

In this article, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware implementation of a multilayer feed-forward neural network, with a log sigmoid activation function and a tangent sigmoid (hyperbolic tangent) activation function has been presented, with more accuracy than any other previous implementation of a neural network with the same activation function. Accuracy is enhanced through the implementation of both the sigmoidal functions using COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm. The CORDIC algorithm is a simple and effective method for calculation of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Simulations and experiments have been performed on the ISim simulation engine of the Xilinx Framework, using the Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) as the programming language. The results show accuracy for a 32-bit and 64-bit input/output, compromising with speed.}

A spline-based approximation function is designed that provides a good trade-off between accuracy and silicon area, whilst also being inherently scalable and adaptable for numerous activation functions. This has been achieved by using a minimax polynomial and through optimal placement of the approximating polynomials based on the results of a genetic algorithm. The approximation error of the proposed method compares favourably to all related research in this field. Efficient hardware multiplication circuitry is used in the implementation, which reduces the area overhead and increases the throughput.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               The chapter describes the unary processing. Unary information representation is any representation in which all digits have the same weight. Unary machines can be probabilistic or deterministic, serial or parallel, averaging or non-averaging, synchronous or asynchronous. The chapter reveals that finger counting is the most ancient unary processing method. Since that time, there has been an enormous evolution in counting, number representation, and arithmetic. Finger counting led to the first arithmetic methods, in the form of the production of notches of equal weight. The chapter illustrates the representation of numbers in ancient Egypt, with the number 659 as an example. It determines the radix with the highest theoretical efficiency and compares it to the efficiency of weighted binary. It discusses probabilistic unary methods and deterministic averaging methods, and provides a comparison of characteristics of information processing methods. Further, the architecture and applications of UNIFIELD I are described.}

abstract = "Although deep neural networks (DNNs) are being a revolutionary power to open up the AI era, the notoriously huge hardware overhead has challenged their applications. Recently, several binary and ternary networks, in which the costly multiply-accumulate operations can be replaced by accumulations or even binary logic operations, make the on-chip training of DNNs quite promising. Therefore there is a pressing need to build an architecture that could subsume these networks under a unified framework that achieves both higher performance and less overhead. To this end, two fundamental issues are yet to be addressed. The first one is how to implement the back propagation when neuronal activations are discrete. The second one is how to remove the full-precision hidden weights in the training phase to break the bottlenecks of memory/computation consumption. To address the first issue, we present a multi-step neuronal activation discretization method and a derivative approximation technique that enable the implementing the back propagation algorithm on discrete DNNs. While for the second issue, we propose a discrete state transition (DST) methodology to constrain the weights in a discrete space without saving the hidden weights. Through this way, we build a unified framework that subsumes the binary or ternary networks as its special cases, and under which a heuristic algorithm is provided at the website https://github.com/AcrossV/Gated-XNOR. More particularly, we find that when both the weights and activations become ternary values, the DNNs can be reduced to sparse binary networks, termed as gated XNOR networks (GXNOR-Nets) since only the event of non-zero weight and non-zero activation enables the control gate to start the XNOR logic operations in the original binary networks. This promises the event-driven hardware design for efficient mobile intelligence. We achieve advanced performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the computational sparsity and the number of states in the discrete space can be flexibly modified to make it suitable for various hardware platforms."

  abstract  = {Decelerating and stopping light is fundamental for optical processing, high performance sensor technologies and digital signal treatment, many of these applications relying on the ability of controlling the amplitude and phase of coherent light pulses. In this context, slow-light has been achieved by various methods, as coupling light into resonant media, Brillouin scattering in optical fibers, beam coupling in photorefractive and liquid crystal media or engineered dispersion in photonic crystals. Here, we present a different mechanism for slowing and storing light, which is based on photo-isomerization induced transparency of azo-dye molecules hosted in a chiral liquid crystal structure. Sharp spectral features of the medium absorption/dispersion, and the long population lifetime of the dye metastable state, enable the storage of light pulses with a significant retrieval after times much longer than the medium response time.}
